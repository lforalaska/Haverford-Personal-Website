We're often told that daily habits are the key to success. Write every day. Exercise every day. Meditate every day. But what if the pressure of daily commitment is actually holding us back?

## The Tyranny of Daily Habits

Daily habits sound great in theory, but they have a fatal flaw: one missed day and the streak is broken. This creates an all-or-nothing mentality that can be demotivating when life inevitably gets in the way.

When you miss a day, you feel like you've failed. And once the streak is broken, it's easy to give up entirely. "I already missed one day, so what's the point?"

## The Weekly Alternative

Instead of daily habits, consider weekly ones. Commit to doing something once a week, every week, for a year. This approach has several advantages:

### Flexibility Within Structure

A weekly commitment gives you flexibility in when you do something during the week, while still maintaining regularity. You can adapt to your schedule while keeping the habit alive.

### Lower Pressure, Higher Consistency

Because the bar is lower, you're more likely to maintain the habit long-term. Missing a week doesn't feel as catastrophic as missing a day, and you're less likely to give up entirely.

### Space for Quality

When you're not racing to complete something every single day, you can take more time with each iteration. A weekly essay allows for more depth than a daily journal entry.

## Making It Work

Here's how to build successful weekly habits:

1. **Choose a specific day**: Don't just say "once a week." Pick a day. Make it recurring.

2. **Start small**: Don't commit to too many weekly habits at once. One or two is plenty to start.

3. **Track your consistency**: Keep a simple record of whether you did it each week. After a few months, you'll have a clear pattern.

4. **Don't break the chain**: The power isn't in daily streaks, it's in weekly consistency over months and years.

## My Own Experiment

This essay series is my own experiment with weekly habits. By committing to one essay per week, I'm giving myself the structure I need to keep writing while allowing flexibility in the actual writing process.

Some weeks the essay might come together on Monday. Other weeks it might be a Saturday night scramble. But the commitment remains: one essay, every week, no matter what.

Let's see where this takes us.
